 #### **By Rowland Wanderi 27/11/2023**

## Description

This project is a Python application that can display the time in 24hr format, check for positive integers and returns the highest value of consonant substrings in a word. 


## Project requirement
  > Python file
  > VS code
  

## Setup
## Running the Application
Clone this repo in your terminal then navigate into its directory.
Open with VS code and click run to view the results on our terminal

## Deliverables

As a user, I can:


Convert a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030") 

Takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and return True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. 

## Known Bugs
    The app works perfectly.
